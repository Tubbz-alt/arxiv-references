        <p>We prove that if A is the basin of immediate attraction to a periodic attracting or parabolic point for a rational map f on the Riemann sphere, if A is completely invariant (i.e. f −1(A) = A), and if µ is an arbitrary f -invariant measure with positive Lyapunov exponents on ∂A, then µ -almost every point q ∈ ∂A is accessible along a curve from A. In fact we prove the accessability of every ”good” q i.e. such q for which ”small neighbourhoods arrive at large scale” under iteration of f . This generalizes Douady-Eremenko-Levin-Petersen theorem on the accessability of periodic sources. We prove a general ”tree” version of this theorem. This allows to deduce that on the limit set of a geometric coding tree (in particular on the whole Julia set), if diameters of the edges converge to 0 uniformly with the number of generation converging to ∞, every f -invariant probability ergodic measure with positive Lyapunov exponent is the image through coding with the help of the tree, of an invariant measure on the full one-sided shift space. The assumption that f is holomorphic on A, or on the domain U of the tree, can be relaxed and one does not need to assume f extends beyond A or U . Finally we prove that in the case f is polynomial-like on a neighbourhood of CI \ A every ”good” q ∈ ∂A is accessible along an external ray.</p>

      <title>In the definition of good q we assume also that lim taken over good n’s. Finally in the definition of good q we assume about each good n that We shall prove the following</title>
      <p>Theorem A generalizes Douady-Eremenko-Levin-Petersen theorem on the accessability of periodic sources.
Remark that in the case of periodic sources one obtains curves along which periodic q is accessible, of finite
lengths, see Section 1. Condition (0.1) holds in the case q is a periodic source for all n’s. Condition (0.3) is
true if A is the basin of attraction to ∞ for f a polynomial, and more generally if A is completely invariant,
i.e f −1(A) = A.</p>
      <p>Condition (0.3) in the case of a source is equivalent to Petersen’s condition [Pe].</p>
      <p>Under the assumption of the complete invariance of A µ -almost every point for µ an invariant probability
measure with positive Lyapunov exponents is good hence accessible, cf. Corollary 0.2.</p>
      <p>In fact we shall introduce in Section 2 a weaker definition of good q and prove Theorem A with that
weaker definition. In that weaker definition parabolic periodic points in ∂A are good. The traces of telescopes
built there can sit in an arbitrary interpetal, so one obtains the accessability in each interpetal. One obtains
in particular Theorem 18.9 in [Mi1].</p>
      <p>Remark that the above conditions of being good are already quite weak. In particular we do not exclude
critical points in Bn,l.</p>
      <p>For example every point in ∂A is good if A is the basin of attraction to ∞ for a polynomial z 7→ z2 + c
which is non-renormalizable, c outside the ”cardioid”. This is Yoccoz-Branner-Hubbard theory, see [Mi2].
(In this case however theorem A is worthless because one proves directly the local connectedness of ∂A.)</p>
      <p>Remark that complete invariance of A, a basin of attraction to a sink, does not imply that f on a
neighbourhood of CI \ A is polynomial-like. (Polynomial-like maps were first defined and studied in [DH].) In
[P4] an example of degree 3, of the form z → z2 + c + z−b a , with a completely invariant basin of attraction
to ∞, not simply-connected, with only 2 critical points in the basin, is described.</p>
      <p>We prove in the paper a theorem more general than Theorem A, namely a theorem on the accessability
along branches of a geometric coding tree. We recall now basic definitions from [P1, P2, PUZ, PS].</p>
      <p>Let U be an open connected subset of the Riemann sphere CI . Consider any holomorphic mapping
f : U → CI such that f (U ) ⊃ U and f : U → f (U ) is a proper map. Denote Crit(f ) = {z : f ′(z) = 0}.
This is called the set of critical points for f . Suppose that Crit(f ) is finite. Consider any z ∈ f (U ). Let
z1, z2, ..., zd be all the f -preimages of z in U where d = degf ≥ 2. (Pay attention that we consider here,
unlike in the other papers, only the full tree i.e. not only some preimages but all preimages of z in U .)
Consider smooth curves γj : [0, 1] → f (U ), j = 1, ..., d, joining z with zj respectively (i.e. γj(0) =
d
z, γj(1) = zj), such that there are no critical values for iterations of f in Sj=1 γj, i.e. γj ∩ f n(Crit(f )) = ∅
for every j and n &gt; 0. We allow self-intersections of each γj.</p>
      <p>Let Σd := {1, ..., d}ZZ+ denote the one-sided shift space and σ the shift to the left, i.e. σ((αn)) = (αn+1).
We consider the standard metric on Σd</p>
      <p>ρ((αn), (βn)) = exp −k((αn), (βn))
where k((αn), (βn)) is the least integer for which αk 6= βk.</p>
      <p>For every sequence α = (αn)n∞=0 ∈ Σd we define γ0(α) := γα0 . Suppose that for some n ≥ 0, for every
0 ≤ m ≤ n, and all α ∈ Σd, the curves γm(α) are already defined. Suppose that for 1 ≤ m ≤ n we have
f ◦ γm(α) = γm−1(σ(α)), and γm(α)(0) = γm−1(α)(1).</p>
      <p>Define the curves γn+1(α) so that the previous equalities hold by taking respective f -preimages of curves
γn. For every α ∈ Σd and n ≥ 0 denote zn(α) := γn(α)(1).</p>
      <p>For every n ≥ 0 denote by Σn = Σdn the space of all sequences of elements of {1, ..., d} of length n + 1.
Let πn denote the projection πn : Σd → Σn defined by πn(α) = (α0, ..., αn). As zn(α) and γn(α) depends
only on (α0, ..., αn), we can consider zn and γn as functions on Σn.</p>
      <p>The graph T = T (z, γ1, ..., γd) with the vertices z and zn(α) and edges γn(α) is called a geometric
coding tree with the root at z. For every α ∈ Σd the subgraph composed of z, zn(α) and γn(α) for all n ≥ 0
is called a geometric branch and denoted by b(α). The branch b(α) is called convergent if the sequence γn(α)
is convergent to a point in clU . We define the coding map z∞ : D(z∞) → clU by z∞(α) := limn→∞ zn(α) on
the domain D = D(z∞) of all such α’s for which b(α) is convergent.</p>
      <p>In Sections 1-3, for any curve (maybe with self-intersections) γ : I → CI where I is a closed interval in
IR, we call γ restricted to J a subinterval (maybe degenerated to a point) of I a part of γ. Consider γ on
J1 ⊂ [0, 1] and γ′ on J2 ⊂ [0, 1] either both γ and γ′ being parts of one γn(α), J1 ∩ J2 = ∅, J1 between
0 and J2 , or γ a part of γn1 (α) and γ′ a part of γn2 where n1 &lt; n2. Let Γ : [0, n2 − n1 + 1] → CI be
the concatenation of γn1, γn1+1, ..., γn2. We call the restriction of Γ to the convex hull of J1 ⊂ [0, 1] and
J2 ⊂ [n2 − n1, n2 − n1 + 1] (we identified here [0, 1] with [n2 − n1, n2 − n1 + 1]) a part of b(α) between γ and
γ′ .</p>
      <p>For every continuous map F : X → X of a compact space X denote by M (F ) the set of all probability
F -invariant measures on X. In the case X is a compact subset of the Riemann sphere CI and F extends
holomorphically to a neighbourhood of X and µ ∈ M (F ) we can consider for µ -a.e. x Lyapunov characteristic
exponent</p>

      <p>Z log(F ′)dµ.</p>
      <p>In this paper where we shall discuss properties of µ -a.e. point, it is enough to consider only ergodic
measures, because by Rochlin Decomposition Theorem every µ ∈ M (F ) can be decomposed into ergodic
ones.</p>
      <p>Denote</p>
      <p>Meχ+(F ) = {µ ∈ M (F ) : µ ergodic χμ(F ) &gt; 0}</p>
      <p>Meh+(F ) = {µ ∈ M (F ) : µ ergodic hμ(F ) &gt; 0}
where hμ(F ) denotes measure-theoretic entropy.</p>
      <p>From Ruelle Theorem it follows that hμ(F ) ≤ 2χμ(F ) see [R], so Meh+(F ) ⊂ Meχ+(F ).
The basic theorem concerning convergence of geometric coding trees is the following:</p>
      <p>Convergence Theorem. 1. Every branch except branches in a set of Hausdorff dimension 0 in
the metric ρ on Σd, is convergent. (i.e HD(Σd \ D) = 0). In particular for every ν ∈ M h+(σ) we have
ν(Σd \ D) = 0, so the measure (z∞)∗(ν) makes sense.</p>
      <p>2. For every z ∈ clU , HD(z∞−1({z})) = 0. Hence for every ν ∈ M (σ) we have for the entropies:
hνϕ (σ) = h(z∞)∗(νϕ)(f ) &gt; 0, (if we assume that there exists f a continuous extension of f to clU ).</p>
      <p>The proof of this Theorem can be found in [P1] and [P2] under some assumptions on a slow convergence
of f n(Crit(f ) to γj for n → ∞) and in [PS] in full generality ( even with f n(Crit(f )) ∩ γj 6= ∅ allowed).</p>
      <p>Let Λˆ denote the set of all limit points of f −n(z), n → ∞. Analogously to the case q ∈ ∂A we say that
q ∈ Λˆ is good if f extends holomorphically to a neighbourhood of {f n(q), n = 0, 1, ...} ( we use the same
symbol f to denote the extension) and conditions (0.0’), (0.1’), (0.2’) and (0.3’) hold. These conditions are
defined similarly to (0.0)-(0.3), with A replaced by U and ∂A replaced by Λˆ.</p>
      <p>Again pay attention that we shall give a precise weaker definition of q good in Section 2. and prove
Theorem B with that weaker definition. That definition will not demand f extending beyond U .</p>
      <p>Theorem B. Let f be a holomorphic mapping f : U → CI and T be a geometric coding tree in U as
above. Suppose
diam(γn(α)) → 0 as n → ∞
(0.4)
uniformly with respect to α ∈ Σd.</p>
      <p>Using a lemma belonging to Pesin Theory (see Section 2) we prove that µ -a.e.q below is good and easily
obtain the following</p>
      <p>Corollary 0.1. Let f be a holomorphic mapping f : U → CI and T be a geometric coding tree in U such
that the condition (0.4) holds. If µ is a probability measure on Λˆ and the map f extends holomorphically
from U to a neighbourhood of suppµ so that µ ∈ Meχ+(f ), then for µ -almost every q ∈ Λˆ satisfying (0.3’)
there exists α ∈ Σd such that b(α) converges to q. In particular µ is a (z∞)∗-image of a measure m ∈ M (σ)
on Σd.</p>
      <p>Remark that Corollary 0.1 concerns in particular every µ with hμ(f ) &gt; 0. Assuming that f extends
holomorphically to a neighbourhood of Λˆ and refering also to Convergence Theorem we see that (z∞)∗ maps
Meh+(σ) onto Meh+(f |Λˆ) preserving entropy.</p>
      <p>The question whether this correspondence is onto is stated in [P3]. Thus Corollary 0.1 answers this
question in positive under additional assumptions (0.3’) and (0.4).</p>
      <p>We do not know whether this correspondence is finite-to-one except measures supported by orbits of
periodic sources for which the answer is positive, see Proposition 1.2.</p>
      <p>Two special cases are of particular interest. The first one corresponds to Theorem A:</p>
      <p>Corollary 0.2. Let f : CI → CI be a rational mapping and A be a completely invariant basin of attraction
to a sink or a parabolic point. Then for every µ ∈ Meχ+(f |∂A) µ -a.e. q ∈ ∂A is accessible from A.</p>
      <p>Corollary 0.3. Let f : CI → CI be a rational mapping, degf = d, and T = T (z, γ1, ..., γd) be a geometric
coding tree. Assume (0.4). Let µ ∈ Meχ+(f ). Then for µ -a.e. q there exists α ∈ Σd such that b(α) converges
to q.</p>
      <p>In Theorem A and Corollary 0.2 in the case f is a polynomial (or a polynomial-like map) and A is
the basin of attraction to ∞, the accessability of a point along a curve often implies automathically the
accessability along an external ray. In the case A is simply-connected this follows from Lindelo¨f’s Theorem.
External rays are defined as images under standard Riemann map of rays tζ, ζ ∈ ∂ID, 1 &lt; t &lt; ∞.</p>
      <p>In the case A is not simply-connected one should first define external rays in the absence of Riemann
map. This is done in [GM] and [LevS] in the case of f a polynomial and in [LevP] in the polynomial- like
situation. We recall these definitions in Section 3.</p>
      <p>We prove in Section 3 the following</p>
      <p>Theorem C. Let W1 ⊂ W be open, connected, simply-connected domains in CI such that clW1 ⊂ W
and f : W1 → W be a polynomial-like map. denote K = Tn≥0 f −n(W ). Then every good q ∈ ∂K is
accessible along an external ray in W \ K.</p>
      <p>An alternative way to prove the accessability along an external ray is to use somehow, as in the
simplyconnected case, Lindelo¨f’s Theorem. This is performed in [LevP]. It is proved there that if q is accessible
along a curve in W \ K and q belongs to a periodic or preperiodic component K(q) of K then it is accessible
along an external ray.</p>
      <p>Pay attention also that for any q ∈ ∂K if K(q) is one point then q is accessible along an external ray.
This is easy, see [GM, Appendix] and [LevP].</p>
      <p>Remark 0.4. (Proof of Theorem A from B and Corollary 0.2 from 0.1). We do not know
how to get rid of the assumption (0.4) in Theorem B and Corollary 1. In Theorem A and Corollary 2 this
condition is guaranteed automathically. More precisely to deduce Theorem A from B and Corollary 2 from 1
we consider an arbitrary tree T = T (z, γ1, ..., γd) in A, where d = deg(f |A), so that γj ∩Sn&gt;0 f n(Crit(f )) = ∅
and p ∈/ Sj=1,...,d γj. Only critical points in A account here. Forward orbits of these critical points converge
to p hence the following condition holds:</p>
      <p>Hence we can take open discs U j ⊃ γj such that
j=1,...,d
[ γj ∩ cl [ f n(Crit(f )) = ∅</p>
      <p>n&gt;0
[
j=1,...,d</p>
      <p>U j ∩ cl [ f n(Crit(f )) = ∅</p>
      <p>n&gt;0
and consider univalent branches Fn(α) of f −n mapping respective γj to γn(α). {Fn(α)}α,n is a normal
family of maps. If it had a non-constant limit function G then we would find an open domain V such that
Fnt (V ) ⊂ U as nt → ∞. If we assumed p ∈/ U j we arrive at a contradiction. This proves (0.4). Finally by
the complete invariance of A we have Λˆ = ∂A.</p>
      <p>In Corollary 0.3 to find T such that (0.4) holds it is enough to assume that the forward limit set of
f n(Crit(f )) does not dissect CI , because then we find T so that (0.5) holds.</p>
      <p>We believe however that in Proof of Corollary 3 we can omit (0.4), or maybe often find a tree such that
(0.3) holds.</p>
      <p>Remark 0.5. Observe that there are examples where (0.4) does not hold. Take for example z in a
Siegel disc or z being just a sink. Even if J (f ) = CI one should be careful: for M. Herman’s examples
z 7→ λz 1z−−aaz / z−b , |λ| = 1, a 6= 0 6= b, a ≈ b,see [H1], the unit circe is invariant and for a branch in it (0.4)
1−bz
fails. These examples are related with the notion of neutral sets, see [GPS].</p>
      <p>Remark 0.6. The assumption f is holomorphic on U (or A) can be replaced by the assumption f is
just a continuous map, a branched cover over f (U ) ⊃ U .</p>
      <p>However without the holomorphy of f we do not know how the assumption (0.4) could be verified.</p>
      <p>Remark 0.7. The fact that in, say, Theorem A we do not need to assume that f extends holomorphically
beyond the basin A suggests that maybe the assumption (0.3) is substantial and without it the accessability
in Theorem A is not true. We have in mind here an analogous situation of a Siegel disc with the boundary
not simply-connected, where the map is only smooth beyond it, see [H2]. Accessability of periodic sources
in the boundary of A in the absence of the assumption (0.3) is a famous open problem and we think that if
the answer is positive one should substantially use in a proof the holomorphy of f outside A.</p>
      <p>The paper is organised as follows: in Section 1 we prove theorem B for q a periodic source, in Section
2 we deal with the general case. The case of sources was known in the polynomial-like and parabolic p
situations [D], [EL], [Pe]. The general case contains the case of sources but it is more tricky (though not
more complicated) so we decided to separate the case of sources to make the paper more understandable.
Section 3 is devoted to Theorem C.</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Section 1. Accessability of periodic sources.</title>
        <p>Theorem D. Let f : U → CI be a holomorphic map and T (z, γ1, ...γd) be a geometric coding tree in
U , d = degf |U . Assume (0.4). Next assume that f extends holomorphically to a neighbourhood of a family
of points q0, ..., qn−1 ∈ Λˆ so that this family is a periodic repelling orbit for this extension (the extension is
also denoted by f ).</p>
        <p>Assume finally that there exists V a neighbourhood of q on which f n is linearizable and if F is its inverse
on V such that F (q) = q then</p>
        <p>F (V ∩ U ) ⊂ U
(0.5)
(1.1)</p>
        <p>Then there exists a periodic α ∈ Σd such that b(α) is convergent to q. Moreover the convergence is
exponential, in particular the curve being the body of b(α) is of finite length.</p>
        <p>Proof of Theorem D. As usually we can suppose that q is a fixed point by passing to the iterate f n
if n &gt; 1.</p>
        <p>Assume that q 6= z. We shall deal with the case q = z later.</p>
        <p>Let h denote the linearizing map i.e. a map conjugating f on a neighbourhood of clV to z → λz with
λ = f ′(q), mapping q to 0 ∈ CI .</p>
        <p>Replace if necessary the set V by a smaller neighbourhood of q so that z ∈/ V and ∂V = h−1 exp{ℜξ = a}
for a constant a ∈ IR.</p>
        <p>For every set K ⊂ clV \ {q} consider its diameter in the radial direction (with origin at q) in the
logarithmic scale, namely the diameter of the projection of the set log h(K) to the real axis. This will be
denoted by diamℜ log(K).
and</p>
        <p>Vm := h−1 exp({ζ ∈ CI : ℜζ &lt; a − m log |λ|}).</p>
        <p>Observe the following important property of γn(w)’s, n ≥ 0, w ∈ Σd :
For every ε &gt; 0 there exists N (ε) such that if a component γ of γn(w) ∩ Rm satisfies
diamℜ log(γ) &gt; ε log |λ| and zn(w) ∈ Vm</p>
        <p>0 &lt; n − m &lt; N (ε)</p>
        <p>Indeed, by (1.2) for every t = 0, 1, ..., m we have f t(zn(w)) ∈ Vm−t so f t(zn(w)) 6= z. Hence n &gt; m. On
the other hand we have</p>
        <p>ε ≤ diamℜ log(γ) = diamℜ log(f m(γ) ≤ Const diam(f m(γ)
So from (0.3) and from the estimate diamf m(γn(w)) = diamγn−m(σm(w)) ≥ ε, we deduce that n − m is
bounded by a constant depending only on ε. This proves (1.3).</p>
        <p>Fix topological discs U 1, ..., U d being neighbourhoods of γ1, ..., γd respectively such that SiN=(1ε) f i(Crit(f ))∩
U j = ∅ for every j = 1, ..., d.</p>
        <p>(There is a minor inaccuracy here because this concerns the case the curves γj are embedded. If they
have self-intersections we should cover them by families of small discs and later lift them by branches of f −t
one by one along the curves.)</p>
        <p>For every γ being a part of γn(w) satisfying (1.2) we can consider
which is a neighbourhood of f m−1(γn(w)). We used here the notation Ft(v) for the branch of f −t mapping
γj to γt(v), v ∈ Σd. Here j = vt.</p>
        <p>Next consider the component W2 of W1 ∩ V containing f m−1(γ). Using Koebe’s Bounded Distortion
Theorem we can find a disc</p>
        <p>W1 = Fn−(m−1)(σm−1(w))(U j )</p>
        <p>W (γ) = B(x, Constελ−m)
diamℜ logW (γ) &lt;
(Remark that this part is easier if (0.5) is assumed. Then we just consider U j’s disjoint with cl Sn∞=1 Crit(f ).)</p>
        <p>By the definition of Λˆ there exist n0 ≥ 0 and α ∈ Σd such that γn0 (α) ∩ V 6= ∅ . By (1.1) there exist
β1, β2, ... each in {1, ..., d} such that for each k ≥ 0 we have</p>
        <p>F k(b(α)) = b(βk, βk−1, ..., β1, α).</p>
        <p>More precisely we consider an arbitrary component γˆ of γn0(α) ∩ V and extend F k from it holomorphically
along b(α).</p>
        <p>Denote for abbreviation βk, βk−1, ..., β1, α by k]α.</p>
        <p>Denote also F k(γˆ) by γˆk] and the part of γn0+k(k]α) between γˆk] and zn0+k−1(k]α) by γk].</p>
        <p>For each k ≥ 0 denote by Nk the set of all pairs of integers (t, m) such that t : 0 ≤ t ≤ k + n0, 0 &lt; m &lt; k
and γt(k]α) satisfies (1.2) for a curve γ being a part of γt(k]α) or a part of γ ⊂ γk] if t = k + n0 and for the
integer m and additionally
{ the part of b(α) between γ and γˆk]} ⊂ Vm.
We write in this case W (γ) = Wk,t,m and γ = γk,t,m. Figure 1 illustrates our definitions:</p>
        <p>Wk1,T,m1 ∩ Wk2,T,m2 = ∅.</p>
        <p>We have now two possibilities:
1. For every k2 &gt; k1 ≥ 0, 0 &lt; m1 &lt; k1, 0 &lt; m2 &lt; k2 and 0 ≤ T ≤ k2 + n0 such that (T, m1) ∈
Nk1 , (T, m2) ∈ Nk2 , supposed the equality of the T -th entries (k1]α)T = (k2]α)T , we have
(The equality of the T -th entries means that f T (Wk1,T,m1 ), f T (Wk2,T,m2 ) are in the same U j.)
2. The case 1. does not hold, what implies obviously the existence of T and the other integers as above
such that πT (k1]α) = πT (k2]α), (i.e. the blocks of k1]α and k2]α from 0 to T are the same).</p>
        <p>Later we shall prove that the case 1. leads to a contradiction. Now we shall prove that the case 2.
allows to find a periodic branch convergent to q what proves our Theorem.</p>
        <p>Denote K = k2 − k1. Repeat that we have
πT (σK (k2]α)) = πT (k1]α) = πT (k2]α).
Denote k2]α by ϑ. We get by the above:</p>
        <p>f K (zT +K (ϑ)) = zT (ϑ).

        <p>But we assumed (this is our case 1.) that for every t, m and j all the sets W (k, t, m) with the t-th entry

        <p>Remark 1.1. Under the assumption z 6= q and moreover q ∈/ Sj=1,...,d γj (which is the case when we

proof of this part of (1.3) is played by Vm2 ∩ γn(ϑ).) Thus m2 − m1 &lt; N (1).</p>
        <p>This observation allows to modify (simplify) slightly Proof of Theorem B. One does not need (1.6) then
.</p>
        <p>Proposition 1.2. Every branch b(α) convergent to a periodic source q is periodic (i.e α is periodic).
There is only a finite number of α’s such that b(α) converges to q.</p>
        <p>Proof. Suppose z 6= q and b(α) converges to q. We can take V , a neighbourhood of q, arbitrarily small.
Then the constant n0 will depend on it. However the above proof shows that we obtain the equality
πT (k1]α) = πT (k2]α)
for k1 − k2 bounded by a constant independent of n0. z 6= q implies that T → ∞ as V shrinks to q. So there
exists a finite block of symbols β such that α = βββ...βα′ (α′ infinite) with arbitrarily many b’s. So α is
periodic. This consideration gives also a bound for the period of α hence it proves finitness of the set of α’s
with b(α) convergent to q. ♣</p>
        <p>Remark that with some additional effort we could obtain an estimate for the number of branches
convergent to q. In the case q is in the boundary of a basin of attarction to a sink this estimate should give
so called Pommerenke-Levin-Yoccoz inequality (see for example [Pe]).</p>

strictly increasing sequence of integers 0 = n0, n1, ..., nk such that each Dt,t−1 is a nonempty component of
f −(nt−nt−1)(Dt) contained in Dt−1 (of course f nt−nt−1 can have critical points in Dt,t−1),
and else</p>
        <p>t/nt &gt; κ for each t,
dist(∂UessDt,t−1, ∂U Dt−1) &gt; δ.
(2.0)
(2.1)
Here the subscript U means the boundary in U and the essential boundary ∂UessDt,t−1 is defined as ∂U Dt,t−1 \
Snnt=−1nt−1 f −n(∂U ).</p>
        <p>Definition 2.3. A (δ, κ, k)-telescope is called n0-significant if Dk is n0-significant.</p>
        <p>Definition 2.4. For any (δ, κ, k)-telescope we can choose inductively sets Dt,l, where l = t−2, t−3, ..., 0
by choosing Dt,l−1 as a component of f −(nl−nl−1(Dt,l) in Dt−1,l−1. We call the sequence</p>
        <p>Dk,0 ⊂ Dk−1,0 ⊂ ... ⊂ D1,0 ⊂ D0
a trace of the telescope.</p>
        <p>Definition 2.5. We call q ∈ Λˆ good if there exist δ, κ &gt; 0 an integer n0 ≥ 0 and a sequence of
n0-significant telescopes Telk, k = 1, 2, ..., where Telk is a (δ, κ, k)-telescope, with traces Dkk,0, Dkk−1,0, ..., D0k
respectively (to the notation of each object related to the telescope Telk we add the superscript k) such that</p>

good in the above sense. Indeed we choose each Δ’s good time and denote these times by n0, n1, ..., of course
then κ in (2.0) is κ/Δ for the old κ from (0.0).</p>
          <p>For each k we define a telescope Telk by taking as Dkk an arbitrary n0-significant component of
B(f nk (q), r). Such a component exists with n0 depending only on r because the set all vertices of the
tree T is by definition dense in Λˆ. Then inductively for each 0 ≤ t &lt; k we choose as Dtk a component of
B(f nt (q), r) ∩ U containing a component Dtk+1,t of f −(nt+1−nt)(Dtk+1), (such a component Dtk+1,t exists by
(0.3’). By (0.2’) an arbitrary choice of traces will be OK.</p>
          <p>Of course in the case of U = A a basin of immediate attraction to a sink or a parabolic point one can
build telescopes with Dtk,l not containing critical points, but there is no reason for that to be possible in
general.</p>

          <p>We can suppose that z ∈/ D0k or at least that each γj, j = 1, ..., d has a point outside D0k. If it is not
so then either there exists l such that each γj has a point outside Dlk,0 for every k in which case in the
considerations below we should consider m ≥ l rather than m &gt; 0 or else there exists j such that γj ≡ q in
which case obviously b(j, j, j, ...) converges to q.

We claim that analogously to the right hand inequality of (1.3) we have for (t, m) ∈ Nk
t ≤ nkm+1 + E + N (δ/E)

      <p>As each set Rmk for m ∈ Ak− is crossed by a part of b(k]αk) between γj for respective j and γˆk] consisting
of at least E edges and one edge cannot serve for more then two Rmk’s we obtain similarly to (1.7):
Ak− := {1, ..., k − 1} \ Ak+ .</p>
      <p>E · ♯Ak− ≤ 2(nkk + n(k) + 1)
♯Ak+ ≥ k − 1 −
(n(k) + nkk + 1) ≥ k(1 −
Fix from now on E &gt; 3/κ and denote η = 1 − E3κ &gt; 0.</p>
      <p>For every 0 &lt; M ≤ k define</p>
      <p>Ak+(M ) := {m ∈ Ak+ : m &lt; M }
♯Ak+(M ) ≥ ηM.
This means that the property (2.6) true for M = k, see (2.5), extends miraculously to every M ∈ Ak+ large
enough. The proof of this claim is the same as for A+:</p>
      <p>k</p>
      <p>Indeed M ∈ Ak+ implies the existence of t such that (t, M ) ∈ Nk. By (2.3) t ≤ nkM+1 + E + N ( Eδ ). Next
we estimate ♯Ak+(M ) similarly as we estimated ♯Ak+ with nkk + n(k) + 1 replaced by nkM+1 + E + N ( Eδ ). We
succeed for all M large enough.</p>
      <p>Now we can conclude our Proof of Theorem B: Let Mn := ( 12 η)−nM0. By (2.6) for every k ≥ 0 and
n ≥ 0 there exists m ∈ Ak+ such that Mn ≤ m &lt; Mn+1.</p>
      <p>For each n = 0, 1, ... there is only a finite number of blocks of symbols of the form πt(k]nk) such that
(t, m) ∈ Nk, m &lt; Mn+1. This is so by (2.4).</p>
      <p>So there are constants t0 ≥ 0 and D0 ∈ Σt0 and an infinite set</p>
      <p>K0 ={k ≥ 0 : there exists m such that</p>
      <p>M0 ≤ m &lt; M1, (t0, m) ∈ Nk, πt0 (k]αk) = D0}</p>
      <p>In K0 we find an infinite K1 etc. by induction. For every n &gt; 0 we obtain infinite Kn ⊂ Kn−1 and
constants tn, Dn such that</p>
      <p>Kn ={k ∈ Kn−1 : there exists m such that</p>
      <p>Mn ≤ m &lt; Mn+1, (tn, m) ∈ Nk, πtn (k]αk) = Dn}
For α ∈ Σd such that πtn (α) = πtn (k]αk), we have that b(α) converges to q.</p>
      <p>We assumed here that tn → ∞ as n → ∞. If sup tn = t∗ &lt; ∞ then also Dn stabilize at D∗ and by (2.3)
zt∗ (D∗) = q. Moreover there exists a sequence of integers j1, j2, ... ∈ {1, ..., d} such that γt(D∗, j1, j2, ...) ≡ q
for all t ≥ t∗ so b(D∗, j1, j2, ...) converges to q.</p>
      <p>(This is not an imaginary case. Consider a source f (q) = q ∈ U and a tree T (q, γ1, γ2) such that
γ1 ≡ q and γ2 joins q with q′ ∈ f −1(q), q 6= q′. Then the above proof gives b(2, 1, 1, ...) the branch for which
γn((2, 1, 1, ...)) =≡ q′ for every n ≥ 1. ♣</p>
      <p>Remark 2.1. It is curious that we did not need in the above proof neither the left hand side inequality
(1.3): t ≥ m − Const for (t, m) ∈ Nk, nor the sets W (k, t, m). As mentioned already in Introduction no
distortion estimates , i.e. no holomorphy was needed. The holomorphy of f is useful only to verify (0.4).</p>
      <p>Proof of Corollary 0.1. This follows immediately from Theorem B and the following fact belonging
to Pesin Theory:</p>
      <p>Let X be a compact subset of CI and F be a holomorphic mapping on a neighbourhood of X such that
F (X) = X. Let µ ∈ Meχ+(F ). Let (X˜ , F˜, µ˜) be a natural extension (inverse limit) of (X, F, µ ). Denote by
π the projection to the 0 coordinate, π : X˜ → X and by πn the projection to an arbitrary n-th coordinate.</p>
      <p>Then for µ˜-a.e. x˜ ∈ X˜ there exists r = r(x˜) &gt; 0 such that univalent branches Fn of F −n on B(π(x), r)
for n = 1, 2, ... such that Fn(π(x)) = π−n(x)), exist. Moreover for an arbitrary l : exp(−χμ) &lt; λ &lt; 1 (not
depending on x˜) and a constant C = C(x˜) &gt; 0
for every z ∈ B(π(x), r), n &gt; 0, (distances and derivatives in the Riemann metric on CI ).</p>
      <p>Moreover r and C are measurable functions of x˜.</p>

        <title>Section 3. External rays.</title>
        <p>Let W1 ⊂ W be open, connected, simply-connected bounded domains in the complex planeCI such that
clW1 ⊂ W . Let f : W1 → W be a holomorphic proper map ”onto” W of degree d ≥ 2. We call such a map
f a polynomial-like map. Denote K = Tn≥0 f −n(W ). This set K is called a filled in Julia set [DH]. We can
assume that ∂W is smooth. Let M be an arbitrary smooth function on a neighbourhood of clW \ W1 not
having critical points, such that M |∂W ≡ 0 and M |∂W1 ≡ 1 and M ◦ f = M − 1 whereever it makes sense.
Extend M to W \ K by M (z) = M (f n(z)) + n where n is such that f n(z) ∈ W \ W1.</p>
        <p>Fix τ : 0 &lt; τ &lt; π and consider curves γ : [0, ∞) → clW \ K, intersecting lines of constant M at the angle
τ , (this demands fixing orientations), not containing critical points for M with γ(0) ∈ ∂W and converging
to K as the parameter converges to ∞. One can change the standard euclidean metric on CI so that τ is the
right angle and think about gradient lines in the new metric. We call such a line a smooth τ -ray. Instead
of parametrizing such a curve with the gradient flow time we parametrize it by the values of M . Limits of
smooth τ -rays are called τ -rays. They can pass through critical points of M . (Such a τ -ray enters a critical
point along a stable separatrix and leaves it along an unstable one, the closest clockwise or counter-clockwise.
If it hits again a critical point for the first time it leaves it along an unstable separatrix on the same side
from which it came to the previous critical point, see [GM] and [LevP] for the more detailed description. See
Fig. 3:</p>
        <p>One easily proves the fact corresponding to (0.4):</p>
        <p>C. Divide each τ -ray γ into pieces γn, n ≥ 1 each joining f −n(∂W ) with

        <p>The proof is the same as that of the implication (0.5) ⇒ 0.4) in Remark 0.4. We have univalent branches
of f −k for all k on neighbourhoods of γn for external rays γ, neighbourhoods not depending on k, for n large
enough, because then critical points of f in W \ K do not interfere. There is finite number of them and their
forward trajectories escape out of W .</p>
        <p>For our q find significant telescopes Telk as in Section 2, where n0-significant means here that Dkk
